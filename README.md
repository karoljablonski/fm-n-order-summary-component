## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties and SASS pre-processor
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned to pay more attention for details and be more patient especially about "easy" stuff to do. I reminded myself how to run sass pre-processor on project. It's nice to have visual sample, so I could compare my work to what it should look like. Also it's my first README.md I created.



### Continued development

Next project I need to implement BEM into project. I also tend to have chaos in naming classes and other elements in simple, not very big projects.

Also get better knowing of all flex and grid properties.

### Useful resources
